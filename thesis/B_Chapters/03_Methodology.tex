\chapter{Methodology}

In this chapter,
the methodological approach,
as well as
the used scientific research methods
are presented.


\section{Approach}
\label{methodology:approach}

To achieve the main goal of the thesis and answer the identified research questions,
a mix of different scientific methods will be used.
In order to help with the recognition and legitimization of the conducted research,
a commonly accepted framework, namely
the methodology for conducting design science (DS) research
in information systems (IS)
\autocite{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch}
will be applied.
It consists of six activities
(illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:dsrmProcessReleasePromotionGitOps}):

\begin{itemize}
	\item \nameref{methodology:activity1}
	\item \nameref{methodology:activity2}
	\item \nameref{methodology:activity3}
	\item \nameref{methodology:activity4}
	\item \nameref{methodology:activity5}
	\item \nameref{methodology:activity6}
\end{itemize}

%Since the model allows for process iteration,
%it will be decided by the researcher
%whether, at the end of activity 5,
%to iterate back to activity 3 to try to improve the artifact.
The process is structured in a nominally sequential order.
For this concrete research,
the problem-centered initiation is chosen as the entry point,
thus the process will begin with activity 1.
Afterwards the research will proceed sequentially,
because the idea of the research resulted from observation of the problem
\autocite{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch}.

\subsection{Activity 1: Identify Problem \& Motivate}
\label{methodology:activity1}

\noindent
In activity 1,
the research problem of
release promotion with GitOps
is defined.
This is accomplished, by
seeking knowledge of the state of the problem
from practicing professionals.
This is done by conducting
semi-structured interviews, as described in section \ref{methodology:interview},
as well as analysing prior written literature.
To assist later evaluation,
the problem is conceptually broken down into distinct items.
The value of a solution is highlighted,
in order to help the audience of the research
understand the reasoning associated with the
researcher's understanding of the problem
\autocite{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch}.

	\label{fig:problemToObjectiveMapping}	
\end{figure}

\subsection{Activity 2: Define Objectives of a Solution}
\label{methodology:activity2}

\noindent
In activity 2,
research objectives are inferred from the problem definition in activity 1.
Each objective maps to a distinct item from the problem specification
(illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:problemToObjectiveMapping}),
which helps with later evaluation in activity 5.
In practice, a research objective will be a qualitative description of
how a new artifact is expected to support a solution to the problem definition.
\bigskip

\subsection{Activity 3: Design \& Development}
\label{methodology:activity3}

\noindent
In activity 3,
solutions for the previously defined objectives are designed and developed
by means of producing an artifact.
This is achieved by
determining the artifact's desired functionality and its architecture,
followed by actually creating the artifact
\autocite{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch}.
In practice this means that:
Abstract model definitions are designed;
with the specification of the model definitions in place,
the "release promotion operator" is developed as an artifact.
\bigskip

\subsection{Activity 4: Demonstration}
\label{methodology:activity4}

\noindent
In activity 4,
the in-context use of the artifact is demonstrated.
After outlining how to use the artifact to effectively provide a solution to the problem definition,
the artifact is implemented in a proof-of-concept-level prototype.
%In practice,
%the prototype 
\bigskip

\subsection{Activity 5: Evaluation}
\label{methodology:activity5}

\noindent
In activity 5,
the implementation of the artifact,
and how well it supports a solution to the problem,
is evaluated.
This is achieved by
comparing the objectives of a solution to actual observed results
from use of the artifact in the demonstration
\autocite{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch}.
In practice this means, that
the functionality of the artifact implemented in the prototype in activity 4,
is compared with the solution objectives from activity 2.
\bigskip

\subsection{Activity 6: Communication}
\label{methodology:activity6}

\noindent
In activity 6, as a final step,
the whole conducted research is communicated by means of
disclosing
the problem and its importance,
the artifact and its utility and novelty,
and the demonstration accompanied by the evalution results
\autocite{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch},
within the publication of a master thesis at
the University of Applied Sciences Burgenland \autocite{fhBurgenlandWebsite}.
In addition, it is communicated to relevant audiences such as
the GitOps Working Group \autocite{gitopsWG} of the CNCF.






\section{Research methods}

In the following section,
the used research methods
semi-structured interview
by
\citeauthor{glaser2010experteninterviews} (\citeyear{glaser2010experteninterviews})
and
design science research methodology for information systems
by
\citeauthor{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch} (\citeyear{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch})
are explained in detail.
%The procedure in the course of the research work is also described.




\subsection{Semi-structured interview}\label{methodology:interview}

For \nameref{methodology:activity1},
semi-structured interviews with working professionals
are conducted.
For this research method,
the suggested practices and guidelines from
the textbook of
\citeauthor{glaser2010experteninterviews} (\citeyear{glaser2010experteninterviews})
are used.
These interviews have the primary goal of aiding with
problem identification and motivation,
because prior written scientific literature is insufficient on the topic.
For conducting the interviews,
a semi-structured interview guide (Appendix \ref{appendix:interview-guide}) is used.

The interview guide is created on the basis of preliminary theoretical considerations.
The use of a guide facilitates the comparability of several interviews,
but still leaves enough room for spontaneous statements.
The advantage of a guide is that the researcher can stick to concrete questions.
Follow-up questioning is allowed and the questions are mostly open.
The open questioning enables the interviewee to present their point of view
\autocite{berger2016wissenschaftliches}.


\subsubsection{Preparing the interviews}

As an initial step,
a semi-structured interview guide is developed.
It serves as a rough guideline for the structure of the interview process.
Additionally it encompasses the content-related interview questions,
which are specific to the given research problem.
These questions can be seen at section \ref{appendix:interview-questions} in the appendix.

The selection of the interview partners is based on the questions mentioned in
\citeauthor{glaser2010experteninterviews} (\citeyear{glaser2010experteninterviews}):

\begin{itemize}
	\item Who has the information relevant to this work?
	\item Who can describe it precisely?
	\item Who is most willing to be interviewed?
	\item Who is available?
\end{itemize}

The pool of potential interview partners is mainly oriented around
contacts from friends and acquaintances,
who are working professionally in the GitOps field.
The contact to the interview partners is done via Slack \autocite{slackWebsite} or e-mail.
Prior to conducting the interview, the interview guide is sent to the interviewee.

\subsubsection{Conducting the interviews}

Appointments for the interviews are made with each interview partner in advance. 
Eventually, the interview is conducted with a web video conferencing tool like Zoom \autocite{zoomWebsite}.
The interviews are recorded for later transcription.
The semi-structured interview guide
is used as a guideline for the interview process as a whole.
However, the actual structure of the interview may differ for each individual interview and according interview partner.

\subsubsection{Transcription and post-processing of the interviews}

The output of the interviews are in the form of audio-video recordings.
These are transcribed word-for-word into a written form afterwards.
The transcriptions can be seen in Appendix \ref{appendix:interview-transcriptions}.
The content-related answers of the interview partners are taken into consideration
for \nameref{methodology:activity1}, and there further processed.





\subsection{Qualitative content analysis}

For \nameref{methodology:activity2},
the transcriptions of the interviews are evaluated with
the qualitative content analysis by
\citeauthor{mayring2019qualitative} (\citeyear{mayring2019qualitative}).

\subsubsection*{Object and research question}

The underlying object for the content analysis are
the conducted semi-structured interviews as described in section \ref{methodology:interview}.

The research questions are presented in the earlier section \ref{introduction:research-question}.

\subsubsection*{Approach}

As the main approach,
the inductive category formation
is chosen.
The first text passage is read,
then a category is formed,
and finally you proceed to the next passage.
For the next passage,
you decide if an existing category matches
or you need to form a new one.
This process continues until all text passages are handled.
At the end, similar categories may be merged together.

\subsubsection*{Coding}

Each text passage is labelled with the according category.

\subsubsection*{Review of categories}

About halfway through the coding process,
\citeauthor{mayring2019qualitative} (\citeyear{mayring2019qualitative})
advises to review the already formed categories.
The following questions may be asked:
Do they represent the content well?
Were they formed in an appropriate relation?
How do possible denotations look?
Could you merge certain categories?

\subsubsection*{Completion of coding process}

After reviewing the categories,
and taking appropriate measures,
the coding process is completed.

\subsubsection*{Reliability check}

Once coding is completed,
a reliability check is done.
How much do the results differ in replication?
This is achieved by letting another independent researcher
execute the coding process.

%Cohens's Kappa (1960)
%Krippendorff's Alpha (1970)

\subsubsection*{Evaluation and interpretation}

A possible way for evaluation would be to check frequencies.

How often does each of the categories occur in the data set?
What does this mean in terms of my research question?
How do my results relate to the existing state of research?













\subsection{Design science research methodology}

The
design science research methodology (DSRM)
has already been described and applied in the earlier section
\ref{methodology:approach} \nameref{methodology:approach}
of this thesis.

\citeauthor{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch} (\citeyear{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch})
describe DSRM as follows:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent
We propose and develop a design science research methodology (DSRM) for the
production and presentation of DS research in IS. This effort contributes to IS research
by providing a commonly accepted framework for successfully carrying out DS research
and a mental model for its presentation. It may also help with the recognition
and legitimization of DS research and its objectives, processes, and outputs, and it
should help researchers to present research with reference to a commonly understood
framework, rather than justifying the research paradigm on an ad hoc basis with each
new paper.

\noindent
\autocite{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch}
\end{quotation}

\enquote*{DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts.}
\autocite{designScienceResearchMethodologyForInformationSystemsResearch}


%DSRM provides a nominal process model consisting of six steps:
%problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication


















%\section{Approach}

%\section{Research methods}
%Die eingesetzte Methoden (z.B. Online-Befragung, Inhaltsanalyse, Interviews) müssen
%ebenfalls nachvollziehbar beschrieben werden.
%Unterschiedliche Untersuchungsmethoden haben oft unterschiedliche Genauigkeit.
%Neben der Begründung und Beschreibung der Untersuchungsmethoden ist auch eine

%Wenn es ein Kapitel 3.2.1 gibt, muss es auch ein Kapitel 3.2.2 geben.

%\subsubsection{<<Überschrift 4. Ebene>>}
%4 Überschriftenebenen müssen reichen.

%\section{Displayed Text}
%Text is displayed by indenting it from the left
%margin.  Quotations are commonly displayed.  There
%are short quotations
%\begin{quote}
%	This is a short quotation.  It consists of a 
%	single paragraph of text.  See how it is formatted.
%\end{quote}
%and longer ones.
%\begin{quotation}
%	This is a longer quotation.  It consists of two
%	paragraphs of text, neither of which are
%	particularly interesting.
%	
%	This is the second paragraph of the quotation.  It
%	is just as dull as the first paragraph.
%\end{quotation}
%Another frequently-displayed structure is a list.
%The following is an example of an \emph{itemized}
%list.
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item This is the first item of an itemized list.
%	Each item in the list is marked with a ``tick''.
%	You don't have to worry about what kind of tick
%	mark is used.
%	
%	\item This is the second item of the list.  It
%	contains another list nested inside it.  The inner
%	list is an \emph{enumerated} list.
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item This is the first item of an enumerated 
%		list that is nested within the itemized list.
%		
%		\item This is the second item of the inner list.  
%		\LaTeX\ allows you to nest lists deeper than 
%		you really should.
%	\end{enumerate}
%	This is the rest of the second item of the outer
%	list.  It is no more interesting than any other
%	part of the item.
%	\item This is the third item of the list.
%\end{itemize}
%You can even display poetry.
%\begin{verse}
%	There is an environment 
%	for verse \\             % The \\ command separates lines
%	Whose features some poets % within a stanza.
%	will curse.   
%	
%	% One or more blank lines separate stanzas.
%	
%	For instead of making\\
%	Them do \emph{all} line breaking, \\
%	It allows them to put too many words on a line when they'd rather be 
%	forced to be terse.
%\end{verse}
%
%Mathematical formulas may also be displayed.  A
%displayed formula 
%is 
%one-line long; multiline
%formulas require special formatting instructions.
%\[  \Gamma \times  \psi = x'' + y^{2} + z_{i}^{n}\]
%Don't start a paragraph with a displayed equation,
%nor make one a paragraph by itself.

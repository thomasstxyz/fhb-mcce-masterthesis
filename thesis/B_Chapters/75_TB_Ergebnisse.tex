\chapter{Results}

The overall goal of the thesis is to
provide a solution to the problem of release promotion in GitOps environments.
In this regard a prototype will be developed
and its functionality demonstrated in a proof-of-concept evaluation.
The goal for the prototype is to implement it as a modular extension to Kubernetes
and existing GitOps tooling.
By doing so, users can promote releases between multiple deployment environments
following the GitOps principles.
The main contribution of this thesis is a proof of concept for the developed prototype
which can be used as an extension to the GitOps toolkit within the CNCF.











%
%The results of the literature review so far show,
%that there is no standard practice for the promotion of releases between multiple environments in GitOps.
%The existing GitOps tools do not provide
%a native solutions for this.
%As a best practice, it is suggested that the promotion operations
%should be outsourced to the CI/CD system
%- in the form of simple file copy operations.
%According to the literature as well as current observations,
%any kind of standardization is missing,
%when it comes to defining multiple environments with GitOps
%and promoting releases between them.

%\noindent
%As the primary outcome of this thesis,
%an answer to the research questions is expected,
%by proposing a software solution as a prototype.
%The developed prototype should ideally serve as a 
%modular extension to Kubernetes and existing GitOps tooling.

%In the end, the results of the research,
%including the developed prototype,
%can be donated to the CNCF.

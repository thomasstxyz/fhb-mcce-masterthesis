\section{General Definitions}
\label{theoretical-background:general-definitions}

The following section includes general definitions of terms on the topic.

\subsection*{Cloud}

TODO

\subsection*{Cloud Native}

TODO

\subsection*{Continuous}
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\enquote*{"Continuous" is intended to match the industry standard term: reconciliation continues to happen, not that it must be instantaneous.}
\autocite{gitopsGlossary}
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{Declarative Description}
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\enquote*{A configuration that describes the desired operating state of a system without specifying procedures for how that state will be achieved. This separates configuration (the desired state) from the implementation (commands, API calls, scripts etc.) used to achieve that state.}
\autocite{gitopsGlossary}
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{Desired State}
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\enquote*{The aggregate of all configuration data that is sufficient to recreate the system so that instances of the system are behaviourally indistinguishable. This configuration data generally does not include persistent application data, eg. database contents, though often does include credentials for accessing that data, or configuration for data recovery tools running on that system.}
\autocite{gitopsGlossary}
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{Drift}
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\enquote*{When a system's actual state has moved or is in the process of moving away from the desired state, this is often referred to as drift.}
\autocite{gitopsGlossary}
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{Environment}
TODO

\subsection*{Feedback}
\begin{quotation}
	\noindent
	\enquote*{Open GitOps follows control-theory and operates in a closed-loop. In control theory, feedback represents how previous attempts to apply a desired state have affected the actual state. For example if the desired state requires more resources than exist in a system, the software agent may make attempts to add resources, to automatically rollback to a previous version, or to send alerts to human operators.}
	\autocite{gitopsGlossary}
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{GitOps}

This thesis aims at adhering to the definition of the term GitOps,
%for the term GitOps, its principles and the glossary around it.
as specified by the CNCF project OpenGitOps.
The overall goal of OpenGitOps is to establish a clear vendor-neutral,
principle-driven meaning of GitOps,
which shall provide a foundation for interoperability between tools, conformance and certification through enduring programs, documents and code
\autocite{opengitopsDocuments}.

\noindent
\enquote*{The primary four principles
	for the desired state of a
	system managed by GitOps are the following} \autocite{gitopsPrinciplesv100}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Declarative} \\
	\enquote*{A system managed by GitOps must have its desired state expressed declaratively.}
	\item \textbf{Versioned and Immutable} \\
	\enquote*{Desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability, versioning and retains a complete version history.}
	\item \textbf{Pulled Automatically} \\
	\enquote*{Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from the source.}
	\item \textbf{Continuously Reconciled} \\
	\enquote*{Software agents continuously observe actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state.}
	\autocite{gitopsPrinciplesv100}
\end{itemize}

% ensure list does not span over multiple pages in PDF export

These principles are defined in OpenGitOps version 1.0.0,
along with glossary
\autocite{gitopsGlossary}
for associated terms and concepts.
%The ones needed for understanding of this thesis,
%are the following:

\subsection*{Phase scheme}
The ideal-typical structure of a project in sections of logically related tasks including the methodology,
methods and techniques of task solution. Synonym: phase model
\autocite{riedlManagementInformatik2019}.

\subsection*{Promotion}
TODO

\subsection*{Prototype}
An executable model of the planned product, produced with little effort and easy to modify,
which can be tested and evaluated by the future user
\autocite{riedlManagementInformatik2019}.

\subsection*{Prototyping}
The entirety of activities, methods and tools required to produce prototypes
\autocite{riedlManagementInformatik2019}.

\subsection*{Prototyping cycle}
A sequence of steps consisting of using, evaluating and modifying a prototype
\autocite{riedlManagementInformatik2019}.





\subsection*{Reconciliation}
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\enquote*{The process of ensuring the actual state of a system matches its desired state. Contrary to traditional CI/CD where automation is generally driven by pre-set triggers, in GitOps reconciliation is triggered whenever there is a divergence. Divergence could be due to the actual state unintentionally drifting from the desired state declarations, or a new desired state declaration version having been changed intentionally. Actions are taken based on policies around feedback from the system and previous reconciliation attempts, in order to reduce deviation over time.}
\autocite{gitopsGlossary}
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{Release}
TODO

\subsection*{Software System}
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\enquote*{A software system managed by GitOps includes} \autocite{gitopsGlossary}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \enquote*{One or more runtime environments consisting of resources under management}
	\item \enquote*{The management agents within each runtime}
	\item \enquote*{Policies for controlling access and management of repositories, deployments, runtimes}
	\autocite{gitopsGlossary}
\end{itemize}
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{State Store}
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\enquote*{A system for storing immutable versions of desired state declarations. This state store should provide access control and auditing on the changes to the Desired State. Git, from which GitOps derives its name, is the canonical example used as this state store but any other system that meets these criteria may be used. In all cases, these state stores must be properly configured and precautions must be taken to comply with requirements set out in the GitOps Principles.}

\section{Beyond container orchestration with Kubernetes}

The following section is about
the role Kubernetes plays in the current cloud native ecosystem,
and its extensible architecture.

Since the birth of the cloud native computing foundation (CNCF) in 2015 and the release of Kubernetes as the first CNCF project,
there have emerged more than a hundred projects.
Most of the projects are hosting cloud native technologies and tools to support Kubernetes.
The current ecosystem and toolchains are strongly centered around Kubernetes,
although not strictly tied to it and often times with the explicit effort
for the ability to support alternative cloud native platforms and solutions.

\enquote*{Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.}
\autocite{kubernetesIoWebsite}
Although this is the primary use case of Kubernetes,
and the reason why it was created initially,
Kubernetes is increasingly being used as a base cloud native platform,
to build other applications and platforms on top of.
The architecture of Kubernetes provides a solid framework and platform,
which is easily extensible.
Developers may extend its API by specifying custom resources and controllers.

There are several advantages when extending the Kubernetes API,
in comparison to a plain REST API.
Some of those are the following
\autocite{kubebuilderBookWebsite}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \enquote*{Hosted API endpoints, storage, and validation.}
	\item \enquote*{Rich tooling and clis such as kubectl and kustomize.}
	\item \enquote*{Support for Authn and granular Authz.}
	\item \enquote*{Support for API evolution through API versioning and conversion.}
	\item \enquote*{Facilitation of adaptive / self-healing APIs that continuously respond to changes in the system state without user intervention.}
	\item \enquote*{Kubernetes as a hosting environment}
	\autocite{kubebuilderBookWebsite}
\end{itemize}

When developing a Kubernetes-native application,
many of the common capabilities which are often required for all applications,
are being provided by Kubernetes itself, or otherwise easily consumable and integrated.
These may include resource quotas, observability, monitoring, logging and tracing,
configuration state storage, declarative APIs, control loops, and event and message queueing.

\subsection*{Extending Kubernetes}
% https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/
Kubernetes offers several different extension points and extension patterns.
Most extension patterns however share the same basic design and principles.
In general, a custom extension is a program which reads and/or writes
to the Kubernetes API. By doing that it can provide useful automation.
Since Kubernetes is based around a declarative API,
where resources are defined as the desired state,
and controllers are responsible for continuously reconciling this
desired state with the actual state,
it has shown to be a good pattern to design custom extensions in the same way
\autocite{extendKubernetes}.

\subsection*{Controllers and Operators}
% https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/
The concept of a controller and control loop within Kubernetes refers to the
meaning from robotics and automation, where
\enquote*{a control loop is a non-terminating loop that regulates the state of a system.}
\autocite{controllersKubernetes}
Controllers in Kubernetes are continuously running in a control loop,
in specified intervals and sometimes internal or external triggers, 
and watch the actual state of the cluster,
and make changes to it by interacting with the API,
in order to bring the actual state closer to the desired state,
like specified in the declarative definition.
It is typically a good practice to have one controller
be responsible for one resource, 
in order to help with separation of concerns.
Controllers make changes to resources inside the cluster,
like pods and deployments,
but can also be responsible for resources external to the cluster,
like APIs of the infrastructure provider.
A typical controller implementation can be seen in figure \ref{fig:typicalControllerKubernetes}
\autocite{controllersKubernetes}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.00\linewidth]{assets/typical-controller.png}
	\caption{typical controller in Kubernetes.
		%		(\citeauthor{ref}, \citeyear{ref}).
	}
	\label{fig:typicalControllerKubernetes}	
\end{figure}

When a controller has specific domain knowledge programmed into its logic,
or does certain tasks, which would usually be done by a human "operator",
it is called an operator.

% https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/
Operators typically are a set of controllers and custom resources
with specific codified domain knowledge.
All operational tasks -
which would otherwise have to be done by a human operator -
are written in code.
This code, the controller logic, can then be automated.
Examples for such operational tasks are
backups and restoring of backups, error remediation, database migrations, etc.
\autocite{operatorWhitepaperV1}.

In overly simplified terms:
An operator is a controller plus domain-specific operational knowledge
(fig. \ref{fig:operatorAndController}).

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.00\linewidth]{assets/operator-is-controller-domain-knowledge.png}
	\caption{Operator and Controller.
		%		(\citeauthor{ref}, \citeyear{ref}).
	}
	\label{fig:operatorAndController}	
\end{figure}

The Operator Design Pattern represents a set of principles about
managing complex applications and/or infrastructure resources,
using domain-specific knowledge.
The goal is to limit any manual work that needs to be done,
and try to automate all operational tasks.
This is done by capturing domain-specific knowledge in code,
defining the desired state of resources and exposing them
via a declarative API
\autocite{operatorWhitepaperV1}.

To simplify the process of creating and maintaining Kubernetes-native application
in the form of an operator,
there exist several operator frameworks.
The most prominent framework is the Kubebuilder Framework.
%\url{https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder}
The Kubebuilder framework makes the process of extending the Kubernetes API
an easy process for developers.
An initial project can easily be boostrapped, allowing the developer to focus
on implementing the custom resource definitions and controller logic.
Any needed Kubernetes primitives, such as service accounts and RBAC permissions
are automatically generated.
Documentation for the OpenAPI resources are also generated from the code,
which is the Go programming language.
There exist rich libraries for interfacing with Kubernetes components,
since Kubernetes itself is also implemented in the Go language
\autocite{kubebuilderBookWebsite}.

%
%\section{Ordinary text}
%% A '%' character causes TeX to ignore all remaining text on the line,
%% and is used for comments like this one.
%
%% sections are begun with similar 
%% \subsection and \subsubsection commands.
%
%The ends  of words and sentences are marked by spaces. It doesn't matter how many 
%spaces    you type; one is as good as 100.  The
%end of   a line counts as a space.
%
%One   or more   blank lines denote the  end 
%of  a paragraph.  
%
%Since any number of consecutive spaces are treated
%like a single one, the formatting of the input
%file makes no difference to
%\LaTeX,                % The \LaTeX command generates the LaTeX logo.
%but it makes a difference to you.  When you use 
%\LaTeX \cite{lamport94},  % \cite inserts a reference, which you define at the end of the document
%making your input file as easy to read
%as possible will be a great help as you write 
%your document and when you change it.  This sample 
%file shows how you can add comments to your own input 
%file.
%
%Because printing is different from typewriting,
%there are a number of things that you have to do
%differently when preparing an input file than if
%you were just typing the document directly.
%Quotation marks like
%``this'' 
%have to be handled specially, as do quotes within
%quotes:
%``\,`this'            % \, separates the double and single quote.
%is what I just 
%wrote, not  `that'\,''.  
%
%Dashes come in three sizes: an 
%intra-word 
%dash, a medium dash for number ranges like 
%1--2, 
%and a punctuation 
%dash---like 
%this.
%
%A sentence-ending space should be larger than the
%space between words within a sentence.  You
%sometimes have to type special commands in
%conjunction with punctuation characters to get
%this right, as in the following sentence.
%Gnats, gnus, etc.\ all  % `\ ' makes an inter-word space.
%begin with G\@.         % \@ marks end-of-sentence punctuation.
%You should check the spaces after periods when
%reading your output to make sure you haven't
%forgotten any special cases.  Generating an
%ellipsis
%\ldots\               % `\ ' is needed after `\ldots' because TeX 
%% ignores spaces after command names like \ldots 
%% made from \ + letters.
%%
%% Note how a `%' character causes TeX to ignore 
%% the end of the input line, so these blank lines 
%% do not start a new paragraph.
%%
%with the right spacing around the periods requires
%a special command.
%
%\LaTeX\ interprets some common characters as
%commands, so you must type special commands to
%generate them.  These characters include the
%following:
%\$ \& \% \# \{ and \}.
%
%In printing, text is usually emphasized with an
%\emph{italic}  
%type style.  
%
%\begin{em}
%	A long segment of text can also be emphasized 
%	in this way.  Text within such a segment can be 
%	given \emph{additional} emphasis.
%\end{em}
%
%It is sometimes necessary to prevent \LaTeX\ from
%breaking a line where it might otherwise do so.
%This may be at a space, as between the ``Mr.''\ and
%``Jones'' in
%``Mr.~Jones'',        % ~ produces an unbreakable interword space.
%or within a word---especially when the word is a
%symbol like
%\mbox{\emph{itemnum}} 
%that makes little sense when hyphenated across
%lines.
%
%Footnotes\footnote{This is an example of a footnote.}
%pose no problem.
%
%\LaTeX\ is good at typesetting mathematical formulas
%like
%\( x-3y + z = 7 \) 
%or
%\( a_{1} > x^{2n} + y^{2n} > x' \)
%or  
%\( AB  = \sum_{i} a_{i} b_{i} \).
%The spaces you type in a formula are 
%ignored.  Remember that a letter like
%$x$                   % $ ... $  and  \( ... \)  are equivalent
%is a formula when it denotes a mathematical
%symbol, and it should be typed as one.
%Furthermore you can add a formula as Images or Tables, see Formula  \hyperref[eq:abc]{\ref{eq:abc}}
%\begin{equation}
%	\label{eq:abc}
%	a+b=c
%\end{equation}
%
%It is sometimes necessary to prevent \LaTeX\ from
%breaking a line where it might otherwise do so.
%This may be at a space, as between the ``Mr.''\ and

\chapter{Evaluation and Results}
\label{evaluation-and-results}

In the following chapter,
the results of the research will be presented,
and evaluated with a holistic view on the research problem of release promotion in GitOps environments.
The results primarily stem from the designed and developed prototype,
and the learning from the prototyping process.
The conducted interviews with the working professionals also gave several interesting insights into
the problem statement from their point of view.
Next to the presentation of the results, they are also evaluated on how they provide a solution
to the problem.
Especially the functionality implemented in the prototype is evaluated against the research objectives,
which have been defined, and map directly to distinct problem items.

The evaluation of the prototype's functionality against the solution objectives,
was carried out in section \ref{prototype:evaluation} earlier in the thesis.
It was proven, that for each solution objective defined in section \ref{interviews:definitionSolutionObjectives}
the respective functionality was implemented in the prototype,
and demonstrated in a proof of concept.
It is described, how for each solution objective,
a solution to the respective problem can be observed in the
proof of concept demonstration in section \ref{prototype:demonstration}.

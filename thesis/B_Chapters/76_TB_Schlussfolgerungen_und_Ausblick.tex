\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

Although the adoption of GitOps brings some advantages on the one hand,
on the other hand, it creates new problems
that did not exist before,
or were better solved with previously followed strategies.
In addition, with GitOps the demands on good software have increased
- as so often -
and new problems have been identified as a result.
These newly identified problems may currently turn out 
to be merely
luxury problems for many organizations.
However, as an organization grows, these current luxury problems
with the increasing growth of an organization
and the increasing demands that come with it,
may emerge as pressing problems.

\noindent
The higher the complexity and the needed degree of automation
of an organization,
as well as the adoption of DevOps
and the principles like
Continuous Integration (CI),
Continuous Delivery (CD),
Continuous Deployment (CDP) -
the more important it becomes to fully automate the promotion of releases in GitOps environments.

%GitOps bringt Vorteile, aber auch Nachteile mit sich.
%Manche Punkte sind mit anderen bzw. früheren Ansätzen

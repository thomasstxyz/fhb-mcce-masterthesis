From the principles of DevOps came GitOps,
as a collection of principles and best practices
for the operation of software systems. At the center,
or to be precise, the source - as the single source of truth -
stands thereby the Git Repository as the revision control system.
The state of the managed system is
completely defined declaratively as code. A GitOps controller
takes care of the continuous reconcilation between the
declared state and the current state.
The promotion of new software releases between several environments
shows itself to be an open problem at present.
Uniform standard practices are missing, as well as necessary tools in the open source community.
This thesis has the goal,
to address the promotion of releases in GitOps environments.
Abstract models of deployment environments as well as promotion workflows
will be defined.
Based on the previously defined models,
a standardized solution for the promotion of releases
will be implemented according to the GitOps principles,
and compared to the existing solutions.

From the principles of DevOps came GitOps,
as a collection of principles and best practices
for the operation of software systems. At the center,
or to be precise, the source - as the single source of truth -
stands thereby the Git Repository as the revision control system.
The state of the managed system is
completely defined declaratively as code. A GitOps controller
takes care of the continuous reconcilation between the
declared state and the current state.
The promotion of new software releases between several environments
shows itself to be an unresolved problem at present.
Uniform standard practices, as well as necessary tools are missing in the open source ecosystem.
This thesis has the goal,
to address the promotion of releases in GitOps environments.
Abstract models of deployment environments as well as promotion workflows
will be defined.
Based on these defined models,
a standardized solution for the promotion of releases
will be implemented according to the GitOps principles,
and compared to existing solutions.
